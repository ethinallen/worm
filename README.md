# Make a Worm (for fun not profit)

## make a python implementation of a Worm
## Copy itself into other programs and inject whatever functionality you want into other programs

### TODO:
#### - currently does not overwrite more than the first file it finds in the list
#### - need to write a cheekier function to inject
#### - need to walk path of entire system and inject into all python files (will set up a vm for this because I am not trying to brick my mac)
